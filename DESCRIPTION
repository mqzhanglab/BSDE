Description: Single-cell RNAseq differential expression analysis for 
    case-control studies using optimal transport. This is a nonparametric method
    for finding differentially expressed genes for case-control studies. 
    Through the use of optimal transportation for aggregating distributions 
    and computing their distances, our method overcomes the restrictive 
    parametric assumptions imposed by standard mixed-effect-modeling approaches.
